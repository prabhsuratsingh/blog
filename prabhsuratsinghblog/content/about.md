Hey! I’m Prabhsurat Singh, a software engineer, community builder, and AI enthusiast from New Delhi, India.
I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science, with a minor in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I love building things, whether it’s a mobile app, a backend service, or an AI model. You’ll usually find me experimenting with new technologies, diving deep into frameworks, and exploring ways to bring complex ideas to life through code.

But beyond work, I’m deeply curious about machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, fields that constantly inspire me. I spend a lot of time reading research papers, books, and exploring ideas in computer vision and CNN architectures, trying to understand how intelligence can be built and improved through data and design.

I’m also passionate about tech communities. As part of Google Developer Groups On-Campus, I’ve led workshops, hackathons, and sessions that help students build real-world projects and grow as developers. Sharing knowledge and creating spaces where people can learn together is something I truly enjoy.

When I’m not coding or reading about AI, you’ll probably find me exploring new tools, sketching out project ideas, or connecting with people who love tech as much as I do, or simply brainstorming the next big project idea over coffee ☕.

If you’re into building cool tech, exploring creative ideas, or just want to chat about AI and software development, I’d love to connect🍻!
